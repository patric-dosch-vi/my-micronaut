# my-micronaut
This is my playground for micronaut.

# Quick Start
Before you build and run the app make sure that following prerequisites are met:

- OpenJDK 11 is installed.
- GraalVM CE for Java 11 is installed https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm
- GraalVM Native Image componend is installed https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/

- Docker: Alternatively to the local installation of GraalVM you can create the native application with the file docker-build.sh, for this make sure to have Docker https://www.docker.com/get-started installed.


# Steps
1. In the first step I followed the Beginner Guide https://guides.micronaut.io/creating-your-first-micronaut-app/guide/index.html on https://micronaut.io, you can find more information and for installation of GraalVM there.
